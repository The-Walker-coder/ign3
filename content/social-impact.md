At IGNASIA Consulting, our mission extends beyond providing exceptional cybersecurity and GRC services. We believe technology and security should empower organisations to create lasting positive change in society.

## Our Commitment

We are dedicated to supporting purpose-driven organisations—from NGOs and nonprofits to social enterprises—that strive for a better world. Through our expertise, resources, and partnerships, we enable these organisations to strengthen their cyber-resilience and governance frameworks, so they can focus on what matters most: making an impact.

## What We Offer

### Preferred Support Programs

We provide tailored consulting packages and services designed specifically for social-impact organisations. These programs give qualifying organisations access to our expert GRC and cybersecurity guidance, with flexible engagement models that respect their unique challenges and resource constraints.

### Pro-Bono & Low-Bono Assessments

For select nonprofit organisations and mission-aligned initiatives, we offer pro-bono or significantly subsidised security assessments. Our goal is to uplift the cyber posture of organisations working for social good, removing barriers to access world-class consulting services.

### Capacity Building & Awareness

We organise workshops, training, and webinars customised for purpose-driven organisations. These programs empower teams with practical knowledge on information security, risk management, and compliance basics—helping them build sustainable security cultures.

### Community & Partnership Engagement

IGNASIA actively seeks partnerships with educational institutions, industry bodies, and social initiatives to co-create security awareness campaigns, research, and collaborative projects that benefit wider communities.
